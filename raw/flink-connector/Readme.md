✅ flink-connector-kafka: Built for Distributed & Scalable Processing
When you use Flink’s Kafka connector in a Flink job, it’s natively integrated with Flink’s parallel dataflow engine.

🔄 What that means:
Each Kafka partition can be assigned to a separate Flink task (subtask).

Flink manages the consumer group coordination, offset tracking, scaling, and parallel ingestion.

You can easily scale your job by increasing parallelism, and Flink automatically spreads the Kafka workload.

🖼️ Example:
Let’s say:

Kafka topic orders has 6 partitions

You run your Flink job with parallelism = 3

Flink will spin up 3 parallel subtasks (threads) like this:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Task 0 → partitions 0 & 1
Task 1 → partitions 2 & 3
Task 2 → partitions 4 & 5
➡️ When you increase parallelism to 6, Flink rebalances the assignment:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Task 0 → partition 0
Task 1 → partition 1
...
Task 5 → partition 5
No manual coordination required.

❌ Apache Kafka Java Client (Raw Approach): Manual Work
With the raw Kafka producer/consumer (e.g., KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer):

You are responsible for managing threads, consumer groups, and partition assignment.

If you want to consume from 6 partitions concurrently, you must:

Create 6 separate threads

Manually assign partitions or rely on subscribe() and build a coordinator

Handle rebalance events yourself (and gracefully stop/start threads)

🛠️ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
consumer.assign(Arrays.asList(new TopicPartition("orders", 0))); // manual partition
Now multiply this logic for all partitions + threads + offset tracking = lots of boilerplate.

⚖️ TL;DR Comparison
Feature	Flink Kafka Connector	Kafka Java Client
Partition-to-thread mapping	✅ Automatic	❌ Manual
Scaling	✅ Increase parallelism	❌ Must manage threads
Offset tracking	✅ Integrated with Flink checkpoints	❌ You track it (e.g., via Kafka or DB)
Fault tolerance	✅ Checkpointed state	❌ Manual recovery logic
Rebalancing on rescale	✅ Handled by Flink	❌ Must write your own

🧠 Real World:
If your app needs to scale up to hundreds of partitions, or you want resilient stream processing with minimal manual work, use flink-connector-kafka.

If you’re building a simple producer for one topic in a microservice, the raw Kafka client is fine.

Let me know if you want to see how this parallelism looks in a real Flink main() function!
